# ðŸŽ® Video Game Sales Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I created this project as part of my data analysis practice using **Microsoft Excel**.  
It is an interactive dashboard built to analyze **video game sales by region, genre, console, and year**.  
The dataset includes **64,016 titles released between 1971â€“2024**, covering North America, Japan, Europe, and the rest of the world.  

The main objective is to explore market trends, identify best-selling consoles and games, and analyze customer preferences by region and genre.
